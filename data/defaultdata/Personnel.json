<p>As a 999 call handler you will likely be dealing with many calls per hour, going through the patient triage and establishing quickly the urgency of the patient before passing them on to receive either hear and treat care from the Clinician or see and treat from the Paramedic team.

<p>As a Clinician you will be used to dealing with patients and providing hear and treat care. You will be able to review the patient incident board in order to prioritise more urgent patients and be able to provide information to them which will prevent the need for an ambulance to attend.</p>
<h4>What information will I be shown?</h4>
<p>As you will be applying hear and treat care, having the relevant patient information to hand is important. NRLS will provide pointers to patient care plans, enabling clinicians to provide a more informed and  time-efficient level of care. The integrated NRLS display itself will bring back pointers which will either provide direct or indirect retrieval of the patient's information.</p>
<h4>Why will I be shown this information?</h4>
<p>As one of few personnel who will be able to provide care to a patient, it is important that you have the correct information in order to provide the best possible level of care. NRLS will help to achieve this by providing you with either Direct or Indirect links to detailed patient information such as their Care Plan. The information within these plans can then be used to hear and treat with greater knowledge about the patients needs and history.</p>
<h4>What does Direct and Indirect return mean?</h4>
<p>The NRLS acts as a service which points users to other pieces of information. Each time a record is created using NRLS, unique pointers are created for that record. Therefore when a consumer of the information such as a Clinician wants to access a patient care plan the NRLS will point them to where and in what format it is stored. If the level of digital capability between producer and consumer allows, the care plan can be returned to the user on screen in full, this is known as a 'Direct return'. If the digital capability isn't capable or not matched between the consumer and provider then static data such as the contact details of the relevant record creator will be provided. This is an 'Indirect return' as the use will able to access the details of the care plan indirectly.</p>",

<p>As a Dispatcher your role focusses on receiving patient information through the incident board and prioritising them in terms of urgency for which patients may require an ambulance.

<h4>What information will I be shown?</h4>
<p>The role of the dispatcher, similar to the call handlers, is also time critical. You'll ensure that ambulances are prioritised correctly in a way that optimises patient response. Information returned from the NRLS in this role will therefore be minimal, as there is little requirement for further information from the patients care plan. It may be possible to flag that an NRLS care plan is present for the patient, which could help inform the paramedic team if the two roles are in contact with one another.</p>
<h4>Why will I be shown this information?</h4>
<p>As there is no identified need for yourself as a Dispatcher to see specific care plan details, a flag will be presented in order to indicate that a care plan is in existence. This information can then be passed on to the Paramedic team if needed, who may need to view the care plan information when administering care. </p>",
