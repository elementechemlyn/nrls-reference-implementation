        <p>As a ${data.personnel.name} within a <a route-href="route: about-consumers-providers;">provider organisation</a> like a ${data.organisation.name} you may never need to see an NRLS pointer or even interact with the NRLS directly.</p>
        <p>The steps below will guide you through the process of how a pointer is created by a provider organisation like a ${data.organisation.name} and then sent to the NRLS.</p>

                    <p class="step-desc">Your ICT and BI departments, with support from other areas such as the IG Lead and CCIO will help to define and scope what will be included in terms of the fields required of a Care Plan.</p>

                    <p class="step-desc">In terms of what you, as the creator of a care plan will have to do - it's business as usual. The creation of these pointers is done 'behind the scenes' which frees you up as the health care professional to focus on creating care plans as best as possible, just like normal.</p>

                    <p class="step-desc">Once you've created the care plan, a pointer will be produced. This is created either directly through NRLS or with your LHCRE if applicable. These pointers can be viewed and read by other organisations which will point said users towards the respective patient's care plan.</p>

                    <p class="step-desc">Consumers are the viewers of the pointer information. The care plan you created, through the help of the your local system and NRLS, will allow authorised users  (e.g Ambulance Services) to view the care plan information.<br />Take a look at the <a route-href="route: actor-organisation-personnel; params.bind: { routeParamId: data.organisation.personnelLinkId }">Ambulance Service</a> area to see what a pointer looks like.</p>
