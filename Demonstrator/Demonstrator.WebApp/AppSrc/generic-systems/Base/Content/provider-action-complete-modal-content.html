    <h4>What happens now?</h4>
    <p>For you nothing else should be required now in terms of the NRLS.</p>
    <p>Now that a care plan exists for this patient your organisation can create a pointer for this record and send it to the NRLS.</p>
    <p>This might happen automatically, but either way this demonstration has helped to show how integrating with the NRLS will not add to your workload.</p>
    <p>There are great benefits of this for your patients and other organisations within the NHS.</p>
    <p>You can view more about the benefits to you, your patients and your organisation from the Benefits button above.</p>

    <h4 class="margin-top-lrg">More Benefits</h4>
    <p>Head over to the Ambulance service section to learn more about the pointers that have been created, what they look like, and the benefits this brings.</p>
