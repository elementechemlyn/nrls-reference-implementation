        <p>
            The National Record Locator Service (<b>NRLS</b>) is a service that aims to help <b>Health &amp; Social Care professionals</b> around the <b>country</b> understand what type of <b>medical records </b>exist for a Patient under their care and where they exist. This is achieved by way of a <b>national index</b> of these records within the NRLS that Organisations can search through.
        </p>
        <p>
            The NRLS also aims to help these care professionals <b>retrieve those records</b> that this index identifies. We call each index item that exists for a record a <b>Pointer</b>.
        </p>

        <h4 class="margin-top-lrg">Providers create Pointers</h4>
        <p>
            These Pointers are created by the Organisations that create the medical records, e.g. a Care Co-Ordinator in a Mental Health Trust creating a Care Plan for a Patient. We call these Organisations <b>Providers</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            These Pointers can be created automatically by the Organisations electronic care systems after a Care Co-Ordinator has created a Care Plan for a patient, for example.
        </p>

        <h4 class="margin-top-lrg">Consumers read Pointers</h4>
        <p>
            These Pointers can then be viewed and read by other Organisations around the country in their electronic care system. We call these Organisations that search for and read points <b>Consumers</b> and an example Consumer Organisation is an Ambulance Service.
        </p>

        <p>
            An example scenario could be a Paramedic out on call treating a patient. This particular patient lives and is receiving specialist treatment in the North East. This patient then visits family in the South West but during their vist require urgent medical treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Using their <b>Tough Books</b> to search the NRLS this Paramedic in the South West now has the potential to not just know that records exist for this Patients specialist care but could also retrieve those records allowing the Paramedic to provide more accurate and timely care.
        </p>

        <h4 class="margin-top-lrg">Security and Data Sharing</h4>
        <p class="alert alert-info alert-panel">
            <i class="fa fa-info fa-padding-sqr n-bg-blue n-text-white"></i> It is important to note that there are <b>levels of security</b> required to use the NRLS and <b>levels of agreement</b> required between Organisations on <b>sharing data</b> before Consumers can view NRLS Pointers and retrieve records.

        <h4 class="margin-bottom-lrg">Benefits to Consumers and Providers</h4>
        <p>The NRLS will bring many benefits to patients, organisations within the NHS, the National Health Service itself, as well services further afield such our national police forces.</p>
        <p class="margin-bottom-xlrg">The benefits can be considered as Primary - Directly effecting patient welfare and at the heart of aims of the National Health Service. Secondary benefits which help organistions such as our Ambulance Services and Health Trusts; and finally Tertiary benefits which are those affecting the NHS as a whole and our services outside of health such as our national police forces.</p>
