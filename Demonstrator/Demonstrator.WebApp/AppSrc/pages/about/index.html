        <p>
            The National Record Locator Service (NRLS) will enable an authorised clinician, care worker and/or administrator, in any health or care setting, to access a patient&#8217;s information to support that patient&#8217;s direct care.
        </p>
        <p>
            This will be achieved by way of a national index of pointers that are essentially bookmarks that can tell authorised clinicians, care workers and/or administrators what records may exist for a patient and where they exist.
        </p>

        <h4 class="margin-top-lrg">Providers create Pointers</h4>
        <p>Pointers are created by the organisations that create the medical records, e.g. a Care Co-Ordinator in a Mental Health Trust creating a Care Plan for a patient. We call these organisations 'Providers'.</p>
        <p>These Pointers can be created automatically by the organisations electronic care systems after a Care Co-Ordinator has created a Care Plan for a patient, for example</p>

        <h4 class="margin-top-lrg">Consumers read Pointers</h4>
        <p>These Pointers can then be viewed and read by other organisations in their electronic care system. We call these organisations that search for and read points 'Consumers' and an example Consumer organisation is an Ambulance Service.</p>
        <p>An example scenario could be a Paramedic out on call treating a patient. This particular patient lives and is receiving specialist treatment in the North East. This patient then visits family in the South West but during their vist require urgent medical treatment.</p>
        <p>Using their mobile device to search the NRLS this Paramedic in the South West can now understand that this patient is undergoing specialist care which allows the Paramedic to provide more accurate and timely care.</p>

        <h4 class="margin-top-lrg">Security and Data Sharing</h4>
        <p class="alert alert-info alert-panel">
            <i class="fa fa-info fa-padding-sqr n-bg-blue n-text-white"></i> It is important to note that there are <b>levels of security</b> required to use the NRLS and <b>levels of agreement</b> required between Organisations on <b>sharing data</b> before Consumers can view NRLS Pointers and retrieve records.

        <h3 id="whyTheNrls" class="n-text-green n-text-bold margin-top-lrg">Why the NRLS?</h3>

        <h4 class="margin-bottom-lrg">Aims of the NRLS <span class="n-text-muted">for phase 1</span></h4>

        <ul class="margin-bottom-xlrg">
            <li>Build a national record index for data Providers and Consumers</li>
            <li>Complement local initiatives, including integrating into existing clinical systems</li>
            <li>Provide the underpinning technical capabilities (Digital Interoperability Platform) that will facilitate integrated care</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="margin-bottom-lrg">NRLS Objectives <span class="n-text-muted">for phase 1</span></h4>

        <ul class="margin-bottom-xlrg">
            <li>To provide a national index to support the health AND [social] care system (e.g. store that record exists) in a chronological order</li>
            <li>To provide a standardised pointer to the record as stored/listed within the index</li>
            <li>To point/locate records of various complexity (e.g. PDF, HTML, FHIR)</li>
            <li>To provide cross border interoperability, transparency and real time information for the purposes of direct care</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="margin-bottom-lrg">The Benefits of the NRLS</h4>
        <p>The NRLS will bring many benefits to patients, organisations within the NHS, the National Health Service itself, as well services further afield such our national police forces.</p>
        <p>The benefits can be considered as Primary - Directly effecting patient welfare and at the heart of aims of the National Health Service. Secondary benefits which help organistions such as our Ambulance Services and Health Trusts; and finally Tertiary benefits which are those affecting the NHS as a whole and our services outside of health such as our national police forces.</p>
        <p>Below you can explore some of the many benefits that the NRLS aims to bring. Currently shown are the benefits delivered through phase 1, however later phases of the NRLS will see the benefits listed here grow along with the organisations and roles that use the NRLS.</p>
