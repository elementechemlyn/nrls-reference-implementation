        <p>We have talked previously about pointers which are essentially bookmarks to medical records.</p>
        <p>These pointers are created and consumed by providers and consumers, who are the organisations and the care professionals at the heart of our health services.</p>

        <h4 class="margin-top-lrg">Providers create Pointers</h4>
        <p>Pointers are created by the organisations that create the medical records, e.g. a Care Co-Ordinator in a Mental Health Trust creating a Care Plan for a patient. We call these organisations 'Providers'.</p>
        <p>These Pointers can be created automatically by the organisations electronic care systems after a Care Co-Ordinator has created a Care Plan for a patient, for example</p>

        <h4 class="margin-top-lrg">Consumers read Pointers</h4>
        <p>These Pointers can then be viewed and read by other organisations in their electronic care system. We call these organisations that search for and read points 'Consumers' and an example Consumer organisation is an Ambulance Service.</p>
        <p>An example scenario could be a Paramedic out on call treating a patient. This patient lives and is receiving specialist treatment in the North East. This patient then visits family in the South West but during their visit require urgent medical treatment.</p>
        <p>Using their mobile device to search the NRLS this Paramedic in the South West can now understand that this patient is undergoing specialist care which allows the Paramedic to provide more accurate and timely care.</p>
