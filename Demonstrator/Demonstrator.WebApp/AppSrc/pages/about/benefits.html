        <p>The NRLS will bring many benefits to patients, organisations within the NHS, the National Health Service itself, as well services further afield such our national police forces.</p>
        <p>The benefits can be considered as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Primary - Directly effecting patient welfare and at the heart of aims of the National Health Service</li>
            <li>Secondary - Benefits which help organisations such as our Ambulance Services and Health Trusts</li>
            <li>Tertiary - Benefits which are those affecting the NHS as a whole and our services outside of health such as our national police forces</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="margin-bottom-lrg">Below you can explore some of the many benefits that the NRLS aims to bring. Currently shown are the benefits delivered through the current phase, however later phases of the NRLS will see the benefits listed here grow along with the organisations and roles that use the NRLS.</p>
