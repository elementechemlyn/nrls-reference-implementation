        <p>There is a process in which each trust must go through to 'on-board' and be granted access to the NRLS.</p>

        <p>
            The process involves meeting security and sharing requirements to use the NRLS and includes agreements between Organisations on sharing data before Consumers can view NRLS Pointers and retrieve records.
