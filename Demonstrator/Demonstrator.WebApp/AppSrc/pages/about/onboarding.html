        <p>There is a process in which each trust must go through to 'on-board' and be granted access to the NRLS.</p>

        <p>
            The process involves meeting security and sharing requirements to use the NRLS and includes agreements between Organisations on sharing data before Consumers can view NRLS Pointers and retrieve records.

        <h4 class="margin-top-lrg">TOM <span>(Target Operating Model)</span></h4>

        <p>
            Connecting to the NRLS via SMSP relies on Suppliers and End Users completing the NHS Digital self-certification tool, known as the Target Operating Model (TOM). The purpose of the Target Operating Model (TOM) is to inform and assist End User organisations with the implementation of SMS integrated systems within their local environment. It provides an assessment framework of their responsibilities in terms of ensuring that their local system meets the technical, IG, Clinical safety and functionality required for the business context.
        </p>

        <p>
            The TOM is typically completed in three phases although in reality some of these can be done concurrently:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Phase 1a: Usage and Settings information provided to NHS Digital for approval</li>
            <li>Phase 1b: Technical Conformance information provided to NHS Digital for approval</li>
            <li>Phase 2: End User Approval</li>
        </ul>
