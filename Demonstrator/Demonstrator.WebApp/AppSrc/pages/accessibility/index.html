        <p>We are working towards ensuring that all pages on this site comply with priority 2 guidelines of the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. While we strive to adhere to the accepted guidelines and standards for accessibility and usability, it is not always possible to do so in all areas of the website. We are continually seeking out solutions that will bring all areas of the site up to the same level of overall accessibility.</p>
