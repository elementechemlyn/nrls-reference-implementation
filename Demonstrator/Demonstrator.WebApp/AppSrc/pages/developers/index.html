        <p>Welcome to the Developer Area, here we aim to introduce you to the code behind the Demonstrator (Interactive Guide) and our development approach which has led us to where we are now.</p>
        <p>First off I just want to briefly describe the 5 main areas within our development and the chosen technology stack.</p>
        <p>The work we have undertaken here can be roughly grouped into 5 areas, or for those Agile enough, epics! These areas have been <strong>Discovery & Planning</strong>, <strong>Front-end Design & Development</strong>, <strong>Back-end Development</strong>, <strong>NRLS Integration</strong> and <strong>Devops</strong>.</p>
        <p>For the most part we have tried to work in <strong>2 weeks sprints</strong> but due to the nature of <strong>Discovery</strong> that has not always been possible given the time required to setup and facilitate meetings and to gather data.</p>

        <h4 class="margin-top-lrg">Discovery & Planning</h4>
        <p>Our Discovery & Planning phase including meeting with System Suppliers and Health organisations that have been identified as <a href="#">[LINK Consumers & Providers]</a> of the NRLS, for the Beta phase of the NRLS project.</p>
        <p>Running alongside this we had early white board session sketching out what the Demonstrator will be and quickly followed by a Solution Design. This was then followed by some early wireframe concepts of our vision for the Demonstrator.</p>

        <h4 class="margin-top-lrg">Front-end Design & Development, Back-end Development</h4>
        <p>Following this we went on to move our wireframe concepts and our Solution Design into something real we can work with.</p>
        <p> As a .NET developer my chosen technology stack here was <strong>Aurelia JavaScript Framework</strong> and a <strong>.NET Core WebAPI</strong> which held the services that was our bridge between then Front-end UI and the NRLS.</p>
        <p>Aurelia is very comprehensive Framework with plenty of features and tools to make our development that much cleaner and leaner, partly by way of its simple conventions and having less need to write boiler plate stuff. It is also standards compliant and forward thinking when we consider what is and will be in the ECMAScript Specification.</p>
        <p>With .NET, what can I say, any .NET developers reading this will agree it is a solid choice and also has a handy <a href="#">[LINK STU3 FHIR Library]</a> available too. With regards to versions of .NET I have chosen .NET Core v2, not just because it is new but like with Aurelia it has some handy features baked in; DI for one meaning more boiler plate stuff can be delegated with very little effort. That and it's cross-platform compatibility opens the field for us in deployment. There is plenty more but I will leave the rest up to Google.</p>

        <h4 class="margin-top-lrg">NRLS Integration</h4>
        <p>There is the obvious need to integrate with the NRLS or at least a version of the NRLS. At the early stages of development the NRLS was not available as a service to integrate with which could be seen as a problem.</p>
        <p>Even early than that during our Back-end development stage there was a need to test what has been created against some sort of FHIR API that at least gave us a FHIR API to interrogate not just for DocumentReference's but also as PDS traces and ODS searches.</p>
        <p>To begin with we chose to deploy a <strong>HAPI FHIR Server</strong> (Java Based) which at least gave us an API that would conform the right data structure without any trouble. The HAPI FHIR Library has an excellent out of the box solution that takes around 15 minutes to set up and deploy. It also open source and free to use which was another good reason for this.</p>
        <p>With that we had something to test against.</p>
        <p>But now during the latter stages we needed to be a bit more specific about our requirements and in LIEU of an NRLS we planned to create an NRLS Stub you could say.</p>
        <p>This was not too dissimilar to our early HAPI FHIR concept but with some constraints around the DocumentReference as the NRLS uses a constrained version of this so additional validation was required.</p>
        <p>We also need to mimic some basic checks around SSP Authentication and JWT's too so this was also handled in our NRLS Stub.</p>

        <h4 class="margin-top-lrg">Devops</h4>
        <p>Lastly, Devops which has really ran throughout is detailed to ensure we maintain integrity around our sprints and also to ensure we have and can deploy and test with ease.</p>
        <p>There are a few things to orchestrate here and in summary:</p>
        <p>From our <strong>GitHub</strong> repo we build our Front-end, Back-end, and NRLS</p>
        <p>Then we can move on to run our tests in each of these areas, mostly Unit Testing and Functional Testing.</p>
        <p>Lastly we deploy! Once complete as far as our Beta plan goes the Demonstrator development is really complete. No new releases are currently planned but you never know bugs have a way of rearing their ugly heads from time to time and in any case we can redeploy with ease on any bug fixes are updates. All of which is orchestrated by Jenkins.</p>

        <h4 class="margin-top-lrg">Data</h4>
        <p>There is also a need to refresh data periodically and so nightly rebuilds do happen which refresh the data and also for an opportunity for new data to be included when new Organisations (Consumers & Providers) are onboarded to the NRLS project.</p>

        <h4 class="margin-top-lrg">Code</h4>
        <p>At the start I mentioned the 'code behind'. This wasn't a lie but if you head over to our GitHub repo you will find a handy <strong>Readme</strong> that will help you get set up and also a more in depth <strong>Wiki</strong> that will take you into more detail around the code written and approaches taken.</p>
