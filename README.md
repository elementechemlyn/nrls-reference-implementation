# NRLS Demonstrator

This project provides a reference implementation of the NRLS API and aims to:
* show an example of integration with the NRLS API
* show examples of how NRLS Data (Pointers) may be consumed within a health care system (e.g. EPR) and how health care systems can provide NRLS Pointers through a step by step interactive guide

Please see the [NRLS API Specification](https://nhsconnect.github.io/FHIR-NRLS-API/) for further details of the NRLS API requirements.

## Structure
The NRLS Demonstrator will be made up of 3 main parts:
* Front-end Single Page App (SPA) (Interactive Guide)
* Back-end API (Supports the SPA and Integrates with the NRLS)
* FHIR based NRLS Stub Server

## Updates
This is the beginning of the project, as we progress more technical details will be presented here along with detailed requirements and setup instructions.
